To run it locally:

- download manhattan-voronoi generator with bugfix from my fork (https://github.com/mlknz/manhattan-voronoi/tree/fix_points_nudge)
- update path to it in sketch-voronoi-manhattan.js (that is entry file)
- run canvas-sketch: canvas-sketch sketch-voronoi-manhattan.js --open --output=export/ (command is also duplicated in comments)
- enjoy
